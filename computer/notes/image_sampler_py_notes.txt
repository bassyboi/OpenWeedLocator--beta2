Purpose: 
- Provides functions for saving images as .png files either as whole images, 
  cropped to bounding boxes, or cropped to squares.
- It has three stand-alone functions:
  - whole_image_save
  - bounding_box_image_sample
  - square_image_sample


Entrypoint:
- None. 


whole_image_save(image, save_directory, frame_id):
- Formats a timestamped name for the image being saved.
- Saves the image as a .png file in the save directory.


bounding_box_image_sample(image, bounding_boxes, save_directory, frame_id):
- Each weed object in the image has an associated bounding box. 
- For each bounding box:
  - The original image is cropped to the bounding box.
  - A timestamped, frame-numbered, box-numbered name for the image is formatted.
  - The image is saved as a .png file in the save directory. 


square_image_sample(image, centres_list, save_directory, frame_id, side_length):
- Produces square images cropped around the centre of each weed in the image. 
- Takes the desired side length of the square image as an input (side_length).
- First ensures that the desired length is at most the height of the image. 
- Then, for each weed in the image:
  - Computes the start location of the image by subtracting half of side_length 
    from the weed's centre, ensuring it's still in the image frame (not negative
    pixel coordinates). 
  - Computes the end location similarly, ensuring its still in the image frame 
    (ensures pixel coordinates don't exceed image dimensions).
  - Crops the image using the start and end coordinates. 
  - A timestamped, frame-numbered, box-numbered name for the image is formatted.
  - The image is saved as a .png file in the save directory.
