Purpose:
- Provides the capability to log things in a general log and a video log .txt.
- It has one class: 
  - Logger


Entrypoint:
- None.


Logger class:
- Called by Controller from relay_control.py, which is called in owl init.
- The video log file is created later in owl if recording is enabled. 
- It has four methods:
  - __init__
  - log_line
  - log_line_video
  - new_video_logfile

Logger class --> __init__ method:
- Sets the directory and timestamped name for the general log 
  (timestamp_weed_log.txt). 
- Creates an empty list for appending all logged messages in-memory (redundant).

Logger class --> log_line method:
- Takes a message and timestamps it.
- Prints the message to the terminal if verbose is enabled.
- Uses context manager to open the log file, append the timestamped message, and
  close the log file (this action also creates the file when it first occurs).

Logger class --> log_line_video method:
- Identical to log_line, but writes to the video log instead of the general log.

Logger class --> new_video_logfile method:
- Sets the name of the video log (timestamp_camera-name_algorithm.txt).
- Prints a confirmation message to the terminal with the file name.
