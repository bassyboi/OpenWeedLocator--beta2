Theory of Operation
System Overview

The LiDAR-based height control system is designed to maintain a consistent distance above crops as the system moves across the field. The system is built around a network of Raspberry Pi nodes, each serving a unique function, such as distance measurement, environmental monitoring, or command and control. This setup allows for scalable and coordinated operation of multiple systems working together.
Core Components and Their Roles

    LiDAR Node:
        Equipped with a LiDAR sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi, this node continuously measures the distance from the sensor to the crop below.
        The Raspberry Pi processes the distance data and decides whether to adjust the height of the system by moving a hydraulic or electrical actuator.
        The LiDAR node publishes distance data over the network to a central command node.

    Central Command Node:
        Acts as a coordination hub for the entire system. It subscribes to messages from the LiDAR node (and potentially other nodes).
        Based on the received data, it can send commands to the LiDAR node to adjust its target height or change its operating parameters.

    Other Purpose Nodes:
        Additional nodes can be added to the network for other purposes, such as soil moisture monitoring, weed detection, or environmental data collection.
        These nodes can communicate with the central command node or directly with each other if needed, allowing for coordinated actions based on the data.

Communication Protocol

    The system uses ZeroMQ, a high-performance asynchronous messaging library, for communication between nodes.
    The PUB-SUB model is used for most communication:
        Publisher (LiDAR Node): Publishes distance measurements to the network.
        Subscriber (Central Command Node): Subscribes to distance measurements and takes appropriate action.

Operational Flow

    Initialization:
        Upon startup, each node initializes its hardware components (LiDAR sensor, actuator, etc.) and establishes network connections using ZeroMQ.

    Distance Measurement and Control:
        The LiDAR node continuously reads the distance to the crop.
        If the measured distance deviates from the target distance beyond a certain threshold, the Raspberry Pi sends signals to the GPIO pins controlling the actuator or hydraulic system to adjust the height accordingly.

    Data Publishing and Command Receiving:
        After each distance measurement, the LiDAR node publishes the distance data over the network.
        The central command node receives the distance data and can send commands back to adjust the target height or change control parameters if necessary.

    Coordination and Decision-Making:
        The central command node analyzes data from all nodes and coordinates actions. For example, if another node detects an obstacle, the central command node might instruct the LiDAR node to pause or change direction.

Scalability and Flexibility

    The system is designed to be scalable; additional nodes can be added to the network without significant changes to the core architecture.
    Nodes can be reconfigured or repurposed by modifying the software, making the system highly flexible for various agricultural applications.

Conclusion

The LiDAR-based height control system with networked communication provides an efficient and scalable solution for maintaining optimal crop height using a network of Raspberry Pi nodes. The use of ZeroMQ enables seamless integration and coordination among nodes, enhancing the system's adaptability to various field conditions and agricultural needs.
